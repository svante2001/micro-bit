Code to the micro:bot

The micro:bot is a robot being controlled with the BBC micro:bit micro controller therefore the brilliant name micro:bot

Code: This project doesnÂ´t have a master code just yet, but different tests for how I am going to code the robot. You will find the code under main.ts

Purpose: The micro:bot is going to attend the DTU Robocup in the spring of 2019.

Notice: kitronik libraries are being used.
